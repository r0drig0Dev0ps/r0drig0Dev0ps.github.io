# Privacy Policy for Math Alarm

**Effective Date:** 17-02-2026

Thank you for choosing Math Alarm. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand what information we do (and do not) collect, and how we use it.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

Math Alarm is a standalone alarm clock application. We believe in privacy by design. Therefore:

*   **We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information or sensitive data from you or your device.**
*   All data created by the app, such as your alarm times and settings (difficulty level, chosen ringtone), are stored exclusively on your device. This data is never sent to us or to any third party.

## 2. Permissions Required

Math Alarm requires certain permissions to function correctly. We only request permissions that are strictly necessary for the app's core features:

*   **`SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` / `USE_EXACT_ALARM`**: Essential for the app to schedule alarms at the precise times you set.
*   **`POST_NOTIFICATIONS`**: Required on modern Android versions to display the alarm notification.
*   **`USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT`**: Allows the app to show the math problem screen over the lock screen.
*   **`VIBRATE`**: Allows the phone to vibrate when the alarm rings.
*   **`WAKE_LOCK`**: Allows the app to wake the device from sleep to sound the alarm.
*   **`FOREGROUND_SERVICE` / `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK`**: Crucial to ensure the alarm sound and vibration continue to play reliably.

## 3. Third-Party Services

Math Alarm does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics, or advertising networks.

## 4. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
